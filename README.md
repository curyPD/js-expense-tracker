# Vanilla JS Expense TrackerðŸ’°

A tiny DOM manipulation practice project that I built over half a year ago and totally forgot about. I'm going to just leave it here.
Users can submit expenses that they can then mark as "Important", "Could've saved up", or "A waste of money" (default option being "Regular"), sort by date or value, delete. Data is not stored anywhere and will disappear on page refreshðŸ˜›.
